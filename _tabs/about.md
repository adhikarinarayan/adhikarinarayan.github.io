      I am an AI Engineer with a passion for leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to create impactful solutions, particularly in areas such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and AI agents. I hold a Master’s degree in Physics from IIT Ropar and a Bachelor’s degree in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics from Kumaun University. Currently, I am contributing to innovative NLP projects at a stealth startup, focusing on document analysis and processing, as well as building intelligent AI agents.

      Beyond my professional work, I enjoy exploring the philosophical implications of AI, discussing books and music, and engaging in sports like cricket and volleyball. I also share my work and insights through presentations (slides available <a href="https://github.com/adhikarinarayan/talks">here</a>). I'm always open to connecting with fellow AI enthusiasts and researchers to discuss new ideas and potential collaborations. Feel free to reach out!
